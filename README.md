#### Aspiring Future Junior Software Developer

Current student at Makers Software Development bootcamp, I was a customer support specialist working in a wide variety of fields from retail to client facing roles in tech and tech education.

In the past 4 years, I've worked with some of the worlds largest clients such as IBM, WPP and the Consumer Technology Association among others to help them improve their social engagement working in social media data analysis. I worked to support these clients as well as help them better understand and optimize their usage of the platform so that they could get the most out of the technology which included Google AI and IBM Watson AI technology. All this technology is shown and used at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) hosted in Las Vegas every year which I helped support in 2017.

In this time, I've also worked to help inform and advise over 300 potential students into taking a leap of faith and join Makers as students. This enabled them to gain the confidence and the skills to transition into a role as a Software Developer and change their lives. This included the support I provided to the team but also allowed me to work on the webcasting and live streaming of content which aided the business with widespread event coverage.

I'm extremely keen to bring my widespread knowledge of different technologies and client facing experience into tech that will undoubtedly help shape how I build and develop new software.

Having spent all this time in tech and having previous interest outside of my employment in tech has only ever drawn me closer into wanting to learn how to build and develop these technologies and the idea that I can be a part of building something that someone might use and love is something that excites me greatly.

## Skills

#### Client Support & Training

My experience here dates back as far as 2010 when I worked in retail at O2 Telefonica advising customers for new tech and mobiles of the time. Since then I have gone on (post university graduation) to work in Japan teaching English as a foreign language. This supported my teaching style which carried over into my next role working with clients such as STA Travel, Ogilvy and Mindshare.
These roles combined required product knowledge and public speaking skills that allowed me to lead regular training sessions with clients where technical expertise and explanations were required.

#### Software and Hardware Troubleshooting and Testing

During my time at both Makers and Buzz Radar, I spent extensive time testing and troubleshooting hardware. That allowed me to learn more about technology I was using but also meant that I would be able to aid with any other issues like this in the future.
In the past, I attended CES in Las Vegas to provide both hardware and software troubleshooting support to the team and with my understanding of code, I was able to troubleshoot more software related issues onsite and provide tangible and concise information back to the developers back in the UK so that they could repair the issue remotely.
